Charlotte's Web is a brand that has been at the forefront of the CBD revolution. Founded in 2013 by the Stanley brothers—Jesse, Jon, and Jim—Charlotte's Web began its journey with a mission to help a young girl named Charlotte Figi, who was suffering from a rare form of epilepsy called Dravet syndrome. Charlotte’s parents sought a natural treatment that would alleviate her debilitating seizures. After much research, they discovered CBD, a non-psychoactive compound found in hemp, and Charlotte's Web was born.

Since then, Charlotte's Web has grown into one of the most respected names in the CBD industry, offering a wide range of products, from tinctures and gummies to topicals and capsules. The brand is known for its high-quality, full-spectrum CBD oils that contain a variety of cannabinoids and terpenes, which work together to create the "entourage effect," enhancing the overall therapeutic benefits of CBD.
